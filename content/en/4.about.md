A few words about me

#intro
Hello! I'm Srijit, a passionate 17-year-old web developer and high school student from Kolkata. My journey in the world of coding is driven by curiosity and a relentless pursuit of innovation. I love diving into new technologies, exploring their possibilities, and creating seamless user experiences.

I believe involving in tech communities is the best way to learn and grow. I'm a Regional Manager at [CodeDay Kolkata](https://codeday.org/kolkata), where I lead a team of volunteers to organize coding events for high school students. I'm also a Club Leader & Community Staff at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), where I mentor students to build projects and host workshops.

When I'm not immersed in code, I enjoy brainstorming creative ideas. I love to watch engineering videos on YouTube, some of my favorite creators being - [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown), [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium), [Electroboom](https://www.youtube.com/@ElectroBOOM), [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips), [Great Scott](https://www.youtube.com/@greatscottlab), [Hacksmith](https://www.youtube.com/@hacksmith), [Michael Reeves](https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelReeves) and [Mark Rober](https://www.youtube.com/@MarkRober).

Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I strive to inspire, innovate, and connect. Let's embark on this journey together!
